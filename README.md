# Quick Start
- **Install**: Download file: `Farouk's Homepage - Shiba Inu` from the repository into your vault to get started.
- **Customize**: Feel free to modify and use any part of the homepage as you like. 
_Thanks for supporting the Shiba Inu theme!_

# Features 
- **Cards and Infobox functionality** (with banner) (By [@SlRvb](https://github.com/SlRvb) ITS Callouts)
- **Automatic humanized greeting heading** (Not included in the theme but it's a simple copy paste here's [Link](https://forum.obsidian.md/t/dataviewjs-get-an-automatic-humanized-morning-afternoon-evening-great-for-user-greetings/33351?u=farouk))
- **Life progress** (By[@SlRvb](https://github.com/SlRvb)) 
- **Countdown** (By [@Rainbell](https://github.com/Rainbell129))

## Cards Layout Set-up (The cards with the banner)
**This is a snippet made by SlRvb, here's a more clear tutorial from him:** 

- [Download](https://github.com/SlRvb/Obsidian--ITS-Theme/blob/main/Snippets/S%20-%20Callouts.css)
- [Guide](https://github.com/SlRvb/Obsidian--ITS-Theme/blob/main/Guide/Callouts.md)

**My tutorial:**
1. After downloading the vault, go to `Farouk's Homepage - Shiba Inu/.obsidian/snippets`. 
2. Drag the `【Main】ITS callouts (infobox, cards).css` to the `.obsidian/snippets` of your vault. (*you can change the name of the snippet if you want*)
3. Then, copy and paste the homepage.md and change it to your liking.


## Automatic humanized greeting heading
1. I've already created a post about it on the obsidian forum : https://forum.obsidian.md/t/dataviewjs-get-an-automatic-humanized-morning-afternoon-evening-great-for-user-greetings/33351?u=farouk
2. All you need is the Dataview plugin. Go to its settings and activate dataviewjs. Copy and paste the code and change the texts as you like. 

## Life Progress
1. install Dataview plugin. Go to its settings and activate dataviewjs.
With "Life Progress.md", copy and paste the code and all you have to do is change the year, month and day corresponding to your birth date.
Here :
![lifeprogress](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/109313204/210932453-406bc4da-2718-47d4-89ea-97c0b956c1a9.png)



For example, if I was born on 10/20/2000, I would write
`year:` 2000,
`month:` 10,
`day:` 20

2. And then the progress bar will be set automatically with a percentage difference of your age at the age of 80. You can change to any age by changing the "80" in the line of code you see in the image above.
3. Your date of birth is for the "Life" line. The rest is already in the code.



## Countdown
- With "Countdown.md", copy and paste the code and add/delete as you like.
